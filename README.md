# `wasmtime-libfuzzer-corpus`

**This repository is deprecated and archived**.

This repository used to contain Wasmtime's seed corpus for new fuzzers. It was
not updated in many years, however, and Wasmtime's fuzzing strategy generally
does not benefit from a seed corpus. As a result the contents of this repository
have been deleted and the repository has been archived.

For more information about fuzzing in Wasmtime see the [contributor
documentation](https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-fuzzing.html).
